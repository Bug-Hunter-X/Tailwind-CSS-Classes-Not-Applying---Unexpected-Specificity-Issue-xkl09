# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly, despite seemingly correct syntax and a functional build process. The issue may stem from unexpected CSS specificity conflicts or incorrect integration with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as Tailwind CSS classes failing to style elements, even though the classes are valid and present in the compiled CSS.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the CSS specificity and potentially adjusting the class order or using more specific selectors to ensure Tailwind CSS rules take precedence.
